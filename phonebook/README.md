# Phonebook coding challenge

This coding challenge is designed by sqior medical to allow you to demonstrate three sets of skills:
* Ability to reason about existing Typescript logic code of unknown ancestory
* Ability to create React components
* Ability to create own Typescript logic code

## Set-up

- Please retrieve the repository "coding-challenge" via git clone - do not fork as this will be visible to other users.
- Install node.js, if not installed yet.
- Switch to the directory "phonebook".
- Run "npm install".
- Run "npm start" - a browser should open rendering the app.
- Use you favorite editor for programming, the app should update automatically after saving.

## Tasks

The app already contains an input field that allows to enter a search term.
Your job is to create React GUI components to dynamically present preliminary results when entering a search term.
The best matches in comparison to an existing set of phonebook entries shall be presented (see screenshot as reference).

For matching, a reference implementation called "PhonebookReferenceImplementation" is provided.
Explanatory comments and variable names have been discarded intentionally.
Be prepared to answer the following questions:
* What type of matching does this implementation provide?
* How do you rate this implementation with respect to functionality and run-time performance?

Please come up with your own implementation of the matching "PhonebookInterface"!
It is permissable to use off-the-shelf npm modules for this task.
Be prepared to answer the following questions:
* What have been your design objectives?
* How do you rate your implementation with respect to functionality and run-time performance?
* Why did you opt for the off-the-shelf modules used, if any?
